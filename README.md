# Hi, I'm [@nixco3](https://github.com/nixco3).  
 My native language is **Spanish** and I speak **English** although I'm still learning it.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I like to program in [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and it's my main language in some way.  
 I'm currently learning [Vue](https://vuejs.org) and sometimes I use [Svelte](https://svelte.dev)/[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev).  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 For now programming for me is a hobby, I haven't fixed anything serious and I would like to take it that way.
